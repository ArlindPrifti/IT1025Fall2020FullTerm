# Executive Summary
The goal of this lab is to create three classes, and to respond some questions about the research project.

# Object Oriented Programming
* Create a class (using paper and pencil or using the Microsoft whiteboard app) for the following:
a) Phone
b) House
c) Employee
* Identify the features (In the video for the Car class, we identified the properties as Year, Make Model etc)
* Identify the actions (In the video for the Car class, we identified the methods as Drive, Park, Start etc)
* Then upload a screenshot of your diagram to github for each of the above classes.

# Research Project
* Explain in 2 lines about your research project. Then answer each of the below questions.
* My research project was about Artificial intelligence and Robotics. It was a very interesting project from my point of view because I learned things that I did not know before.
* How did you find your sources? What are sources that you should avoid when doing good research?
* I found the sources online by searching with Google. Sources that we should avoid are non trustworthy sources like wikipedia or sources written by non professionals.
* What did you find most useful about doing this project? What did you learn?
* It helped me a lot having a pre organized PowerPoint presentation. I learned that Artificial intelligence and Robotics are going to have a big impact on our lives.
* What was the hardest part of doing this project?
* The hardest part for me was drafting and finding the right material to study.
* If a team member did not co-operate or had a different idea than yours, explain how you worked with that team member.
* If a team member would not have co-operated, I would ask the reason why he did not co-operate and try to help him/her to be more active by reminding them that tis project is for our good. If someone had a different idea, I would have talked with my team member to decide which idea is better for the project.

# Conclusion
From this lab I have learned how to create classes.
